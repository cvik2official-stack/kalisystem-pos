  # Fix Cart Creation Policies

  ## Overview
  Updates RLS policies to allow anonymous users to create carts and cart items
  for the Telegram mini app functionality.

  ## Changes
  1. Update carts table policies to allow anonymous inserts
  2. Update cart_items table policies to allow anonymous inserts

  ## Security Notes
  - Anonymous users can create carts but cannot view others' carts
  - This is necessary for the Telegram mini app to work without authentication
